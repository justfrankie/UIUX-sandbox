# Frankie's Mini Music-Player

*This project was done in a sprint of a day, with about 6 hours spent researching, brainstorming features, product design, code development, and UI cleanup*

The code-pen version can be found here: https://codepen.io/justfrankie/full/OJRExOE

Extras: The theme was inspired for the recent cyberpunk 2077 game release, and wanted to have a list of sci-fi tracks/thumbnails-- all fictional btw!

If I had more time for this sprint, I'd certain clean up the UI a bit with improvements like: 

* Enlarging track-seeking bar a bit for easier track-seeking
* Adding a time-stamp pop-up when move hovers over the seeking bar.
* Color accent on hovering over play/pause/next/back buttons.
* Shuffle button and loop button in a new row under the main controls.
* A full webpage-length player at the bottom of the viewport, similar to Spotify/Soundcloud's web players.
